Printers and  plotters, disk drives, robots, CNC machines, and other precision  machines are common examples where the stepper motor is used  extensively. 

A stepper motor's operation can be explained by considering a series of  electromagnets arranged in a circle to encapsulate a rotor made up of a  magnetic material. When these solenoids, or electromagnets, are  energized in sequence, the magneto motive force (MMF) developed in  them interacts with the rotor and causes it to re-align to the magnetic  field, thereby causing it to rotate in a clockwise or counterclockwise  direction. The motor's angular displacement can be controlled by simply  switching these electromagnets on or off in a fixed pattern for the desired  motion of the motor.  

The motor controller implemented in this design uses a MAX 10 device to  govern (as you have predetermined) the performance and operation of a  unipolar permanent magnet stepper motor. The design uses a few  switches and buttons on the demo board to serve as the user interface. This motor controller design offers the following advantages: - Two types of control for starting and stopping the motor and  selecting forward or reverse rotation: manual control (through the  user interface) or automatic control (through a microcontroller). - Two modes of operation: continuous mode and step mode. - Eliminates the need for an external clock signal as all MAX 10 devices  have a unique internal oscillator which is incorporated in this design.
